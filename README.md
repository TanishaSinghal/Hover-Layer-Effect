# Hover-Layer-Effect
This is yet another Hover Effect on images using only html and css (made with the help of yt videos with some creativity of my own). When you hover on the images , the image rolls up and the text beneath with roll up along with certain layers also rolling up showing the text to read . It can be used for product details on your site.
